# Department of Mysteries

April 2019

A text adventure game played on the command line, based on events which occur during the Second Wizarding War circa 1995.

The game is based on J.K Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix".


## The Story

The story begins when you touch down in London atop a Thestral, to steal a prophecy from the Ministry of Magic.

But who are you? Your decisions and actions determine your purpose for obtaining the prophecy. Who do you report to?

## Progress?

I've left the game incomplete but at a pretty straight edge so it is still playable. I'd have liked to have taken the story forward but it's served it's purpose, to practise python but more specifically `control flow` -  a concept I was initially struggling to grok.

I'm still on a steep learning curve with python, and it seems a good time to move to a new project that continues to push my skills further.

Maybe one day I will come back to this.


## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/sophiefitzpatrick/department-of-mysteries.git`
2. `sudo pip3 install termcolor`
3. `python3 play.py`
