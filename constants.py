		The Dark Lord is rising in power with a deadly following of loyal Death Eaters.

		For months he has been dwelling on a place hidden deep within the Ministry of Magic.

		only as \"Unspeakables\". 

		The Department of Mysteries.

		A prophecy made some 15 years previously, ties the Dark Lord's fate with that of Harry Potter. 
		
		He knows only of the first half, it is as follows:

		==============================================================================
		The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
		Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies . . .
		==============================================================================

		If he is ever to rise again, Harry Potter must be destroyed. The Dark Lord must hear the 
		prophecy in full.
		'''
