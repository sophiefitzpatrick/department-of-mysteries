DESCRIPTION_BRAIN_ROOM = '''
		The door opens, you step inside.

		The room is long and rectangular. The place is empty except for a few desks 
		and, in the very middle of the room, an enormous glass tank of deep green liquid, 
		big enough to swim in; a number of pearly-white objects are drifting around lazily.

		You pause, this isn't the fabled Hall of Prophecy, but something about this room intrigues you.
		You want to explore it further, but know you have a quest to complete.
		'''
EXPLORE_CHOICE_INPUT = "Do you walk over to the tank or head back to the black circular room to try a different door?: "
EXPLORE_CHOICE_WRONG_INPUT = "Try \"leave\" or \"explore\": "
BRAINS_WINGARDIUM_LEVIOSA = '''
		You walk up to the tank.

		Brains! Glimmering eerily, they drift in and out of sight in the depths of the green liquid, 
		looking something like slimy cauliflowers.

		You want a closer look before you touch one, the water obscures the brains. 
		Why would they be keeping brains at the Ministry of Magic?

		You reach for your wand and use a levitation charm, wingardium leviosa.
		'''
WINGARDIUM_LEVIOSA_WRONG_INPUT = "Good try, give \"wingardium leviosa\" a go: "
BRAINS_ACCIO = '''
		A brain rises from the deep green liquid, and hovers creepily above the tank.

		On closer inspection, the brain is wrapped in ribbons of what looks like moving film. Horrified, 
		it dawns on you that what you are seeing are thoughts.

		You know there are ways in the wizarding world of stepping into someone's memories, could this be the same
		with thoughts?

		You could lower the brain back into it's green watery depths or summon the brain - could these thoughts
		provide a clue?

		To summon, a simple spell will do - accio. Alternatively lower your wand, and allow the brain to drop back into the tank.
		'''
ACCIO_INPUT = "What move do you make?: "
NO_ACCIO = '''
		Good choice, you have a quest to complete - no time for brains!
		You come to your senses, retreat from the brains and head back to the black circular room.
		'''
BRAINS_DIFFINDO = '''
		You seem to momentarily freeze as the brain soars towards you across the tank, spinning, unravelling
		it's ribbons of moving film.

		You reach out to catch the brain, but as soon as it makes contact with your skin, the film tentacles 
		wrap around your arm like ropes.

		The thin ribbons begin spinning around your chest, you can't breathe.

		You wrack your brains, you know there is a charm that will cut through the tentacles and release you.
		- but what is it?
		'''
BRAINS_SURVIVED = '''
		Excellent, you remembered!

		The spell cuts through the ribbons and the brain releases it's grip, it floats serenely back across
		the room and flops back into the depths of the dark green liquid.

		Time to retreat back to the circular room and rethink your strategy.
		'''
BRAINS_DIED = '''
		You died, ironically your own brain failed you.
