DEATH_HALL_DESCRIPTION = '''
		The door opens, the room is larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular.

		The centre is sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep. You're stood on the
		topmost tier of what seems to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep
		steps like an ampitheatre.

		In the middle of the pit on the lowest level, there stands a raised stone dais, on which stands a
		stone archway that looks so ancient, cracked and crumbling that you're amazed it stands unsupported.

		The archway is hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness
		of the old surrounding air, is fluttering very slightly as though it has just been touched.

		Could someone else be here?

ROOM_CHOICES = "Do you ask \"who's there?\" or back out of the room?: "
DAIS_WHISPERING = '''
		There is no answer but the veil continues to flutter and sway as though someone has just passed through it.

		You scramble down the benches until you reach the stone bottom of the sunken pit. Your footsteps
		echo loudly as you walk towards the stone dais.

		The pointed archway looks much taller from where you now stand.

		You have the strangest feeling that there is someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of
		the archway.

		Gripping your wand, you edge around the dais, but there is nobody there. The rippling continues.

		There is a beauty about it, you're mesmerised and feel a strong inclination to climb up on to dais 
		and walk through it.

		Just as you are about to turn and leave, you hear a faint whispering and murmuring coming from the otherside
		of the veil.

		It sounds like there are people in there, maybe they could help you find the Hall of Prophecy.

DEATH_DIED = '''
		You died, the whispering you hear is the souls of the dead. They welcome you.

DEATH_SURVIVED = '''
		Excellent choice, there was something sinister about that dais. 

		You climb the stone steps and exit the room.
