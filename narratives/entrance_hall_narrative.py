ENTRANCE_HALL_DESCRIPTION = '''
		You are standing in a large, circular room.

		Everything in here is black including the floor and ceiling; 5 identical, unmarked, handleless 
		black doors are set at intervals all around the black walls, interspersed with branches of candles
		whose flames burn blue; their cool, shimmering light reflects in the shining marble floor 
		makes it look as though there is dark water underfoot.

		You shut the door.

		A great rumbling noise begins and the room begins to rotate. You no longer know which 
		door you entered from.

		The only way is forward.

		The doors are labelled 1 to 5.

CHOOSE_DOOR_INPUT = "Choose a door to try: "
RETURN_MARK_DOOR = '''
		You're out!

		The door shuts behind you, you feel the cool darkness surround you. Time to collect your thoughts.
		It might be a good idea to mark the door you just exited before the room begins to rotate.
		
		'''
SYMBOL_INPUT = "What symbol will you mark the door with?: "
RETURN_ROTATING_ROOM = '''
		A great rumbling noise begins and the room begins to rotate. Your symbol is holding up.

		Excellent!

		Time to choose another door, and be on your way!
