DESCRIPTION_SPACE_ROOM = '''
		The door bursts open, you step inside, it slams shut behind you.

		The room is pitch black, weird orbs seem to float through the space. Instinctively,
		you know this isn't the fabled Hall of Prophecy but there is a door across the room.

		You're curious.
		'''
FORWARD_BACK_INPUT = "Do you take a step forward or turn back and choose another door from the circular room?: "
CHOICE_WRONG_PROMPT = "Try \"forward\" or \"back\": "
PLANETS_DESCRIPTION = '''
		You take a step forward, but wait, what's happening!

		Your feet lift off the floor, you're floating. Time is distorted as your whole being slows down.
		You drift higher and higher, rotating as you go. The dimensions of the room are no longer visible 
		- the floor, the ceiling and the door across the room have all melted to nothingness.

		You look down but you can no longer see your body, do you even exist?

		Your consciousness floats closer to the orbs and you realise they are planets. It dawns on you that you are 
		in a living replica of our solar system. 

		A large planet looms ahead, you can make out a huge red spot on its surface. This planet must be Jupiter. 79 moons
		satellite this giant planet.

		You've learnt their names in Astronomy!
		'''
JUPITERS_MOONS_INPUT = "Can you name one of Jupiter's biggest moons?: "
MOON_CORRECT = '''
			Excellent! Well done, this kind of knowledge won't help you here though . . .
			'''
MOON_INCORRECT = '''
			Well you can't be expected to remember everything Professor Sinistra said . . .
			'''
PORTKEY_ESCAPE = '''
		You must find a way out and back to gravity. You have an idea. 

		Maybe you can turn a planet into a portkey. Would this kind of magic work inside the Ministry of Magic?
		After all it is a highly regulated charm.

		A portkey is an ordinary object that can transport a witch or wizard to any place with a singular touch.

		You've never attempted this spell before but have studied the theory. You need to focus really hard on
		picturing the portkey's destination-to-be. This rules the secondary door out, you don't yet know 
		what lies behind.

		You cast around for an object to transform into a portkey. All you see are planets.
		'''
PORTKEY_CHOICE_INPUT = "Which planet would you like to create a portkey out of?: "
PORTUS_CHARM = '''
		Perfect choice, go ahead and turn %s into a portkey. Remember to focus, the charm is `portus`.
		'''
PORTKEY_TRAVEL = '''
		Immediately after casting, you notice %s glowing bright blue, the portkey is ready.
		 
		You touch the portkey, and feel an invisible hook around your waist. You're stuck to the portkey
		as you spin faster and faster.

		Your feet slam against a marble floor.
