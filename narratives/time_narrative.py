DESCRIPTION_TIME_ROOM = '''
		The door opens, you shade your eyes from the beautiful, dancing, diamond sparkling light until 
		your eyes grow accustomed. You see clocks gleaming from every surface,
		large and small, grandfather and carriage, hung in spaces between the bookcases or stood on desks
		ranging the length of the room, so that a busy relentless ticking fills the place like a thousand
		miniscule marching footsteps. The source of the diamond bright light is a towering crystal bell jar
		that stands at the end of the room.

		Time. This room must be where Unspeakables study time.

		A curiosity grips you, it couldn't hurt to have a poke around. Yet you do have a quest to fulfil and 
		and this certainly isn't the Hall of Prophecy.

FORWARD_BACK_INPUT = "Do you continue into the room, or turn back to the circular room to try another door? "
BELLJAR_DESCRIPTION = '''
		The spirit of adventure grips you, you walk tentatively towards the belljar.

		As you get closer it's size becomes apparent. Almost as tall as you are and full with what looks like
		glittering wind. Drifting along in the sparkling current inside is a tiny jewel-bright egg. As it rises in the
		jar, it cracks open and a hummingbird emerges. The bird is carried to the very top of the jar, but as it
		falls on the draught its feathers become bedraggled and damp again. By the time it reaches the bottom of the jar
		it is enclosed in it's shell once more.

		You watch this 4 times, you're entranced.

		A door stands ajar to the left of the belljar, but you're not sure you can tear yourself away from
		the hatching and dying bird. Maybe a closer look is what you need.

BELLJAR_CHOICE_INPUT = "Do you continue through the door or edge closer to the belljar? "
BELLJAR_CHOSEN_DESCRIPTION = '''
		You lean forward, your nose touches the glass.

		Suddenly, you're sucked forward. Your head enters the belljar, sinking through the crystal as though
		it were a soap bubble.

		Before you know what's happening your mind races forward, at first you become smarter and wiser,
		then foretful and tired. Your head and mind have aged. You're close to death, you have lived a long life
		and you can feel it. When he comes you'll greet Death like an old friend and leave arm in arm.

		But wait, what's happening?

		Death all of a sudden seems incomprehensible, you're in your prime, your mind and head are growing younger. Just
		as you begin to feel yourself again, the knowledge you once knew is gone. You know less and less as you hurtle towards
		your imminent birth.

		But your body is still your own and in panic you pull your head out of the belljar.

		In your haste you stumble backwards into a huge glass cabinet, breaking it's contents.
